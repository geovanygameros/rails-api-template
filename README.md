- FactoryBot to generate dummy data
- Sidekiq
- HTTParty
- Devise
- JWT
- Codecov to record your testing coverage
- Timecop

#Setup

This template was built with Rails 7.0.3.1. To install it run ``gem install rails -v 7.0.3.1 ``


Just update the main module name (``MyAmazingApp``) in ``/config/application.rb `` to match with your app name

E.g
```ruby
module MyAmazingApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    ...
```

```ruby
module RocketTravelersAPI 
  class Application < Rails::Application
    ...
```

Create your `.env`, you can use the `.env.example` as a template and put your own settings

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
And that's it, you're ready to go ðŸš€
